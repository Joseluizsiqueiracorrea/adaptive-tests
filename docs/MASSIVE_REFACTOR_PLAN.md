# MASSIVE REFACTOR - FAST EXECUTION PLAN

## 🎯 GOAL: Clean Monorepo Structure NOW
**Timeline**: 1 hour
**Strategy**: Move fast, break things, fix later
**Current State**: Symlinks removed, shims half-assed, WHO CARES - we're moving everything

---

## 🚀 JUST DO IT - PARALLEL EXECUTION

### Package A: RIP OUT OLD STRUCTURE ✅ DONE
- Symlinks deleted
- Half-assed shims created
- Moving on

### Package B: JAVASCRIPT - MAKE IT WORK
**Just do this:**
```bash
# Create proper package.json
cat > languages/javascript/package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "adaptive-tests",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "bin": {
    "adaptive-tests": "cli/init.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint src/"
  }
}
EOF

# Make sure all the JS shit is actually in languages/javascript/
# Fix imports later
```

### Package C: TYPESCRIPT - MAKE IT STANDALONE
```bash
# Fix the package.json to not depend on broken paths
# Update imports to be relative
# Make it build
```

### Package D: PYTHON - ALREADY MOSTLY WORKS
```bash
cd languages/python
# Just make sure it has all its files
# Fix the imports
python -m pytest || true  # who cares if it fails now
```

### Package E: JAVA - ALREADY WORKS
```bash
cd languages/java
mvn test  # probably already passes
```

### Package F: ROOT CONFIG - WIRE IT ALL TOGETHER
```bash
# Root package.json with workspaces
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "adaptive-tests-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "languages/javascript",
    "languages/typescript",
    "languages/python",
    "languages/java",
    "tools/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm test --workspaces",
    "build": "npm run build --workspaces --if-present"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Package G: DELETE ALL THE OLD CRAP
```bash
# After everything's moved
rm -rf src/
rm -rf packages/
rm -rf examples/ templates/ types/
# Delete all the old shit we don't need
```

## 🔨 EXECUTION STEPS

### STEP 1: MOVE EVERYTHING (15 minutes)
```bash
# JavaScript - ensure everything's there
ls -la languages/javascript/src/       # Core code
ls -la languages/javascript/cli/       # CLI stuff
ls -la languages/javascript/examples/  # Examples
ls -la languages/javascript/plugins/   # Jest/Vite/Webpack plugins

# TypeScript - ensure everything's there
ls -la languages/typescript/src/       # TS discovery
ls -la languages/typescript/types/     # Type definitions
ls -la languages/typescript/examples/  # TS examples

# Python - already moved
ls -la languages/python/

# Java - already moved
ls -la languages/java/
```

### STEP 2: FIX IMPORTS (20 minutes)
- Update all `require('../../../whatever')` to local paths
- Update all `require('packages/whatever')` to workspace refs
- Update all `require('src/adaptive')` to proper paths

### STEP 3: MAKE EACH PACKAGE WORK (20 minutes)
```bash
# Test each independently
cd languages/javascript && npm install && npm test
cd languages/typescript && npm install && npm test
cd languages/python && python -m pytest
cd languages/java && mvn test
```

### STEP 4: WIRE ROOT (5 minutes)
```bash
# From root
npm install  # Install all workspaces
npm test     # Run all tests
```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS =
- Each language in its own directory
- No symlinks
- No confusing dual locations
- Each package works independently
- Root commands work

## ❌ DON'T CARE ABOUT =
- Temporary breakage
- Failed tests during migration
- Missing shims
- Backward compatibility

---

## WHO DOES WHAT

### Agent 1: JavaScript
- Fix languages/javascript completely
- Make sure CLI works FROM THAT DIRECTORY
- Update all internal imports

### Agent 2: TypeScript
- Fix languages/typescript completely
- Update imports to use relative paths
- Make it build

### Agent 3: Python
- Already mostly done
- Just verify and fix imports

### Agent 4: Root Config
- Create workspace package.json
- Delete old directories
- Final cleanup

## CURRENT STATUS

| What | Where | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| JavaScript core | languages/javascript/src | Moved, needs import fixes |
| JavaScript CLI | languages/javascript/cli | Moved, broken imports |
| TypeScript | languages/typescript/ | Moved, needs fixes |
| Python | languages/python/ | Moved, mostly works |
| Java | languages/java/ | Moved, works |
| Old src/ | src/ | DELETE AFTER FIXING |
| Old packages/ | packages/ | DELETE AFTER FIXING |

**LET'S GO. MOVE FAST. BREAK THINGS. FIX THEM IN THE NEW STRUCTURE.**

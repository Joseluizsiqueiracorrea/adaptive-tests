### Package A: RIP OUT OLD STRUCTURE âœ… DONE
- Symlinks deleted.

- Created `package.json` for `@adaptive-tests/javascript`.
- Fixed all internal imports to use relative paths.

### Package C: TYPESCRIPT âœ… DONE
- Moved all source code to `languages/typescript/`.
- Created `package.json` for `@adaptive-tests/typescript`.
- Configured to depend on the new `@adaptive-tests/javascript` workspace package.

### Package D: PYTHON âœ… DONE
- Verified code is self-contained in `languages/python/`.
- Imports are local.

### Package E: JAVA âœ… DONE
- Verified code is self-contained in `languages/java/`.

### Package F: ROOT CONFIG âœ… DONE
- Created root `package.json` with workspaces for all language packages.
- Added root scripts to run tests and builds across all workspaces.

### Package G: DELETE ALL THE OLD CRAP âœ… DONE

## ðŸ”¨ EXECUTION STEPS - COMPLETED

### STEP 1: MOVE EVERYTHING âœ… DONE
- All language-specific code was moved into the `languages/*` monorepo structure.

### STEP 2: FIX IMPORTS âœ… DONE
- All `require()` and `import` statements were updated to use local, relative paths within their respective packages.

### STEP 3: MAKE EACH PACKAGE WORK âœ… DONE
- Independent package testing confirmed that each workspace is installable and its tests pass.

### STEP 4: WIRE ROOT âœ… DONE
- `npm install` and `npm test` from the root successfully install all dependencies and run all tests across the monorepo.

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA MET
- Each language is in its own directory.
- No symlinks remain.
- No confusing dual locations for source code.
- Each package works independently.
- Root commands work across all workspaces.

## Tests That Never Break When You Move Files

**Stop fixing import errors.** Traditional tests break every time you reorganize code because they use hardcoded file paths. Adaptive Tests find your code by understanding what it looks like, not where it lives.

## The Problem Every Developer Knows

You refactor your codebase ‚Üí Tests explode with import errors ‚Üí You waste hours fixing paths instead of shipping features.

**We eliminated this problem entirely.**

## Before and After

### Traditional Tests (Break When Files Move)

```javascript
// Hardcoded file path - breaks when you move Calculator.js
import { Calculator } from '../utils/Calculator';

test('calculator works', () => {
  const calc = new Calculator();
  expect(calc.add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

### Adaptive Tests (Work Anywhere)

```javascript
// Finds Calculator by structure, not location
const Calculator = await discover({
  name: 'Calculator',
  type: 'class',
  methods: ['add', 'subtract']
});

test('calculator works', () => {
  const calc = new Calculator();
  expect(calc.add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

**Move `Calculator.js` anywhere in your project. The adaptive test still works.**

## Quick Start

### JavaScript

```bash
npm install @adaptive-tests/javascript
npx adaptive-tests init
```

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install @adaptive-tests/typescript
npx adaptive-tests init
```

### Python

```bash
pip install adaptive-tests-py
adaptive-tests init
```

### Java

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.adaptivetests</groupId>
    <artifactId>adaptive-tests-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## How It Works

Instead of importing by file path, you **discover** code by its structure:

- **Name**: What is it called?
- **Type**: Is it a class, function, or module?
- **Methods**: What methods does it have? (for classes)
- **Exports**: What does it export? (for modules)

Our discovery engine analyzes your code's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to find matches based on these structural characteristics.

## Perfect For

- **ü§ñ AI-powered development** - Let Copilot/Cursor reorganize without breaking tests
- **üèóÔ∏è Large refactors** - Clean up tech debt without hours of import fixing
- **üì¶ Big codebases** - Find code instantly in massive projects
- **üöÄ Fast iteration** - Stop wasting time on broken imports

## Framework Support

Works with your existing test framework:

| Framework | Language | Package |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Jest | JavaScript | `@adaptive-tests/javascript` |
| Mocha | JavaScript | `@adaptive-tests/javascript` |
| Vitest | JavaScript | `@adaptive-tests/javascript` |
| Pytest | Python | `adaptive-tests-py` |
| JUnit | Java | `adaptive-tests-java` |

## Real Example

**Before** - Fragile imports that break when you reorganize:

```javascript
import { UserService } from '../../../backend/services/users/UserService';
import { AuthService } from '../../../backend/auth/AuthService';
import { Database } from '../../../infrastructure/db/Database';
```

**After** - Resilient discovery that works anywhere:

```javascript
const UserService = await discover({ name: 'UserService', type: 'class' });
const AuthService = await discover({ name: 'AuthService', type: 'class' });
const Database = await discover({ name: 'Database', type: 'class' });
```

title: Adaptive Tests - Tests That Never Break
---

<div align="center">

# Your Tests Break When You Move Files.
## **Ours Don't.**

<br>

### 🎯 Move `UserService.js` anywhere. Tests still pass.
### 🚀 Refactor your entire codebase. Tests still pass.
### ✨ Let AI reorganize everything. Tests still pass.

<br>

```javascript
// This breaks when you move files ❌
import { UserService } from '../../../services/UserService';

// This works no matter where files live ✅
const UserService = await discover('UserService');
```

## The Problem We Solve

Every developer knows this pain:

1. **You refactor** → Move files to better locations
2. **Tests explode** → `Cannot find module '../old/path'`
3. **You waste hours** → Fixing imports instead of shipping features

**We eliminated this problem entirely.**

---

## Quick Start

Pick your language and start in literally 2 minutes:

### JavaScript / TypeScript
```bash
npm install @adaptive-tests/javascript
npx adaptive-tests init
```

### Python
```bash
pip install adaptive-tests-py
adaptive-tests init
```

### Java
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.adaptivetests</groupId>
    <artifactId>adaptive-tests-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

---

## How It Works

Traditional tests use **file paths** to find code:
```javascript
import { Calculator } from '../utils/Calculator'; // Breaks when moved
```

Adaptive tests use **code structure** to find code:
```javascript
const Calculator = await discover({
  name: 'Calculator',
  type: 'class',
  methods: ['add', 'subtract']
}); // Works anywhere
```

We analyze your code's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to find what you're looking for based on its structure, not its location.

## Real Examples

### Before (Fragile)
```javascript
// Break every time you reorganize
import { UserService } from '../../../backend/services/users/UserService';
import { AuthService } from '../../../backend/auth/AuthService';
import { Database } from '../../../infrastructure/db/Database';

describe('User management', () => {
  // If any file moves, tests fail before even running
});
```

### After (Bulletproof)
```javascript
const { discover } = require('@adaptive-tests/javascript');

// Find by what they ARE, not where they live
const UserService = await discover({ name: 'UserService', type: 'class' });
const AuthService = await discover({ name: 'AuthService', type: 'class' });
const Database = await discover({ name: 'Database', type: 'class' });

describe('User management', () => {
  // Move files anywhere. Tests keep working.
});
```

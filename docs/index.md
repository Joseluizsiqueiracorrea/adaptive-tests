## The Vicious Cycle of Traditional Testing

Youâ€™ve been there. You move a file, rename a folder, or let an AI agent refactor your code. Suddenly, your entire test suite explodes.

```diff
- import { Calculator } from '../utils/Calculator';
+ import { Calculator } from '../math/calculator/Calculator'; // You have to fix this manually

// ...and this...
- import { UserService } from '../../services/users';
+ import { UserService } from '../../api/v1/users';

// ...and dozens more.
```

You spend the next hour hunting down broken `import` statements instead of building what matters. **This is a waste of your time.**

## The Adaptive Solution: Test Smarter, Not Harder

Adaptive Tests donâ€™t rely on brittle file paths. They find your code by its **structural signature**â€”what it *is*, not where it *is*.

```javascript
// This test works even if you move the file.
const Calculator = await discover({
  name: 'Calculator',
  type: 'class',
  methods: ['add', 'subtract']
});

test('calculator works', () => {
  const calc = new Calculator();
  expect(calc.add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

**Move `Calculator.js` anywhere. The test still passes. No changes needed.**

## How It Works: A New Paradigm

Instead of hardcoding a file path, you provide a "signature" that describes the code you want to test. Our discovery engine does the rest.

1. **You Define a Signature:** Describe the code's name, type, methods, or other structural features.
2. **Engine Scans Your Code:** It parses your codebase's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to find files that match the signature.
3. **It Finds the Best Match:** A powerful scoring algorithm ranks candidates to find the perfect match.
4. **Your Test Runs:** The engine provides the correct module to your test, which runs as usual.

This all happens in milliseconds, and itâ€™s completely transparent.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Get up and running with your preferred language.

### JavaScript / TypeScript

> Heads up: the TypeScript package re-uses the JavaScript discovery engine. Installing `@adaptive-tests/typescript` will pull in `@adaptive-tests/javascript` automatically.

```bash
# 1. Install the package
npm install @adaptive-tests/javascript --save-dev

# 2. Run the interactive setup
npx adaptive-tests init
```

### Python

```bash
# 1. Install the package
pip install adaptive-tests-py

# 2. Run the interactive setup
adaptive-tests init
```

**[â†’ Full Python Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anon57396/adaptive-tests/main/languages/python/README.md)**

### Java

Add the dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.adaptivetests</groupId>
    <artifactId>adaptive-tests-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

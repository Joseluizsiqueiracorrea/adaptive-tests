# 🗺️ Adaptive Tests Roadmap

> **Our Mission**: Eliminate test maintenance burden so developers can focus on building great software.

## 🎯 Vision

Adaptive Tests will become the standard way to write resilient test suites. We envision a world where:

- Tests never break due to file reorganization
- Refactoring is fearless and frequent
- Test maintenance drops from 30% to near 0% of dev time
- Every major framework has adaptive testing built-in

# Proof: Adaptive Tests Are Real Tests

Some skeptics might think adaptive tests just always pass because they "find something."

**This is false. Here's proof:**

## The Three-Scenario Test

Run `npm run validate` to see all three scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Working Code

Both traditional and adaptive suites pass because the code is correct.

### Scenario 2: Moved Files (Refactored)

Traditional breaks on imports. Adaptive finds the moved file and tests it.

### Scenario 3: Broken Implementation

Both fail with the same test assertion errors.

## What This Proves

1. **Adaptive tests validate real functionality** - They fail when code is broken
2. **They fail for the right reasons** - Assertion failures, not import errors
3. **They're doing the same validation as traditional tests** - Same test failures

## The Key Difference

| Scenario | Traditional | Adaptive | Why |
|----------|------------|----------|-----|
| Working code | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | Both validate correctly |
| Moved files | ❌ Import error | ✅ Pass | Adaptive finds the target |
| Broken code | ❌ Test failure | ❌ Test failure | Both catch real bugs |

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Break the calculator implementation
npm run demo:broken

# Both test suites fail with assertion errors
npm run test:traditional  # ❌ Actual test failures
npm run test:adaptive     # ❌ Same test failures!

# Restore working code
npm run restore:broken

# Both pass again
npm run test:traditional  # ✅
npm run test:adaptive     # ✅
```

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **"Adaptive tests just always pass"** - No, they fail on real bugs
❌ **"They're not really testing anything"** - They run the exact same assertions
❌ **"It's just a fancy mock"** - No mocks, they test real implementations
❌ **"Discovery hides failures"** - Discovery errors are reported clearly

## The Bottom Line

Adaptive tests are **real tests** that happen to be smart about finding their targets.

They don't eliminate test failures—they eliminate the wrong kind of test failures (broken imports) while preserving the right kind (actual bugs).
Need a quick regression check? Run `npm test` to execute both the JavaScript and TypeScript suites. Use `npm run test:typescript` for the TS-only flow.

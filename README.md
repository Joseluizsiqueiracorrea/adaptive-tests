Adaptive Tests keeps your suites green no matter how you reorganise your code. The
engine uses **zero-runtime discovery** powered by AST analysis, so test targets are
resolved without ever `require`-ing application modules during discovery. Move
files, rename directories, refactor into new layers—adaptive suites still find the
code they care about, while traditional suites keep failing with import errors.

---

## Why Teams Adopt Adaptive Tests

- **Zero-runtime discovery** – candidate modules are inspected with `@babel/parser`
  instead of `require()`, eliminating side effects and making discovery completely
  deterministic.
- **Async-first scanning** – the engine walks large repositories with
  `fs.promises`, keeping Jest/Node responsive.
- **Deep structural signatures** – classes, functions, inheritance chains,
  methods, and instance properties are validated from the AST before a module is
  ever loaded.
- **Robust caching** – canonical JSON cache keys and mtime-aware entries avoid
  stale hits while keeping repeat runs fast.
- **Drop-in tooling** – CLI, factory helpers, and an abstract Jest base class mean
  you can adopt a single file at a time or migrate whole suites.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install adaptive-tests
```

Optional for TypeScript source discovery (tests will still run against compiled
output if you skip this):

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node
```

Python teams can mirror the same patterns with the companion package:

```bash
pip install adaptive-tests-py
```

Once installed, discover code directly from a test:

```javascript
const { discover } = require('adaptive-tests');

it('authenticates a user', async () => {
  const AuthService = await discover({
    name: 'AuthService',
    type: 'class',
    methods: ['login', 'logout'],
    properties: ['sessions']
  });

  const service = new AuthService();
  const result = await service.login({ username: 'ada', password: 'secret' });

  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
});
```

Need a reusable engine? Grab one from the factory:

```javascript
const { getDiscoveryEngine } = require('adaptive-tests');
const engine = getDiscoveryEngine(process.cwd());
```

---

## CLI Helper

```bash
npx adaptive-tests init
npx adaptive-tests scaffold src/services/UserService.js
npx adaptive-tests scaffold --batch src/  # Scaffold entire directory
```

Use `npx adaptive-tests scaffold --help` for all options. Helpful flags include:

- `--typescript` – emit `.test.ts`
- `--force` – overwrite existing test files
- `--apply-assertions` – generate starter assertions (defaults to TODOs)
- `--all-exports` / `--export <Name>` – control multi-export files
- `--batch <dir>` – scaffold an entire directory
- `--json` – machine-readable output

The CLI scaffolds an `adaptive` test directory, drops in example suites, and
links any missing optional peers (such as `ts-node`). Additional CLI helpers
include the Discovery Lens (`why`) and refactor scripts documented below.

Need visibility into why a signature matched (or didn’t)? Use the Discovery
Lens companion:

```bash
npx adaptive-tests why '{"name":"UserService"}'
npx adaptive-tests why '{"name":"UserService"}' --json
```

The `why` command prints a ranked list of candidates with score breakdowns and
optional JSON output for tooling.

## Validation Flow

The repository ships with a validation script that proves adaptive suites behave
the way we advertise:

```bash
npm run validate
```

The script runs four scenarios:

1. ✅ Both traditional and adaptive suites pass on healthy code.
2. ✅ After a refactor, traditional suites fail with import errors, adaptive suites
   keep passing.
3. ✅ When we introduce real bugs, both suites fail with assertion errors.
4. ✅ TypeScript mirrors the JavaScript story.

## CI/CD Strategy

### Why Adaptive Tests Excel in CI/CD

Traditional CI requires complex dependency tracking to run only affected tests. **Adaptive tests flip this paradigm** — since they're resilient to refactoring, you can run the entire suite without fear of false failures from moved files!

### Our Two-Track Approach

1. **Traditional Tests** → Run only changed tests for quick feedback
2. **Adaptive Tests** → Run ALL of them (they won't break from refactoring!)

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  traditional-tests:
    # Quick feedback on direct changes
    run: npx jest --onlyChanged

  adaptive-tests:
    # Comprehensive coverage, resilient to refactoring
    run: npm run test:adaptive
```

### The Key Insight

You don't need complex test selection for adaptive tests because:
- ✅ They survive file moves and renames
- ✅ They're fast enough to run completely
- ✅ They catch real bugs, not import errors

**Example**: Move `Calculator.js` to a new folder?
- Traditional tests: ❌ `Cannot find module '../src/Calculator'`
- Adaptive tests: ✅ Find it automatically and pass!

## Publishing

Adaptive Tests ships on npm and PyPI:

- npm: [`adaptive-tests`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adaptive-tests)
- PyPI: [`adaptive-tests-py`](https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-tests-py/)

When you are ready to publish a new release:

1. Ensure `npm test` and `npm run validate` are green.
2. Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with release notes.
3. `npm version <patch|minor|major>` followed by `npm publish`.
4. `cd packages/adaptive-tests-py && python -m build && python -m twine upload dist/*`.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Dates are omitted when historical records are unclear.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-21

### Breaking

- Removed the shared language plugin registry and `BaseLanguageIntegration` shim from the JavaScript runtime. The package now ships only the JavaScript/TypeScript discovery engine and no longer bundles the experimental PHP, Ruby, Rust or Wolfram collectors.
- TypeScript installs now wrap the JavaScript engine explicitly. Installing `@adaptive-tests/typescript` will pull in `@adaptive-tests/javascript` automatically.

### Added

- `discover()` accepts an options object so callers can pass `{ rootPath, discovery: {...} }` without first creating an engine instance.
- File system scanning is hardened: `LRUCache` parameters are validated, path resolution is fully async, and traversal outside the project root is blocked.
- GitHub Action: automatically installs `adaptive-tests@0.3.0`, exposes coverage paths, and respects the repoâ€™s preferred package manager via `install-command`.
- Release tooling: added `npm run publish:all` plus a build script for companion plugins to keep Marketplace packages in sync.

### Changed

- Scaffolding CLI (and VS Code command) now loads the adaptive-tests API via dynamic import and surfaces clearer error messages.
- Cleaned up legacy calculator examples, removed deprecated scripts, and refreshed package metadata across the workspaces.
- Consolidated CI workflows: modern Node.js baselines, leaner job matrix, and consistent validation across JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python suites.

### Documentation

- Reworked Quick Start + language guides to clarify that JavaScript is the shared core, TypeScript is a thin wrapper, and Python/Java ship independent engines.
- Updated landing page, comparison guide, and troubleshooting docs for the new install flow and supported languages.

  - Development server API endpoint for discovery
  - Discovery manifest generation for CI/CD

- **NEW: Webpack Plugin (preview)** - Created `webpack-plugin-adaptive` for Webpack integration
  - Automatic loader configuration for adaptive test files
  - Build-time discovery optimization
  - Smart caching with watch mode support
  - Bundle size impact analysis
  - Chunk optimization for test files
  - Discovery manifest generation
- **Build pipeline** - Added `scripts/build-packages.js` and `npm run build:plugins` for offline-friendly builds of companion packages.
- **Repo hygiene** - Introduced `npm run clean:artifacts` and a release checklist to keep shared snapshots lightweight.

## [0.2.3]

- Improved cross-platform file matching with case-insensitive comparisons

## [0.2.2]

- Refreshed all public documentation (README, PROOF, ROADMAP, AGENTS, CONTRIBUTING) for accuracy
- Introduced markdownlint configuration and CI enforcement
- Bumped npm package metadata in preparation for publish
- Added the Discovery Lens CLI (`npx adaptive-tests why`) for deep-dive scoring diagnostics
- Aligned Python companion package version (adaptive-tests-py 0.2.5) and cleaned packaging metadata (SPDX license expression)

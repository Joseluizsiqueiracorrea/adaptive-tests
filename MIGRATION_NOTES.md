# Migration Status – Completed

## Date: 2025-09-20

## 🎯 Objective
Finish the monorepo refactor by removing symlinks, deleting legacy directories, and making each language package self-sufficient.

## ✅ Final State
- All code now lives under `languages/<language>/...`
- Root `node_modules` removed; each package installs its own dependencies on demand
- No compatibility shims remain
- JavaScript and TypeScript workspaces expose their own `package.json`, `jest` configs, and pass their internal test suites
- Python and Java packages are ready to install/test from their respective directories

## 📂 New Layout
```
languages/
  javascript/     # @adaptive-tests/javascript workspace
  typescript/     # @adaptive-tests/typescript workspace
  python/         # adaptive-tests-py package
  java/           # adaptive-tests-java package
  php/            # placeholder for future refactor
  go/             # "
  rust/           # "
  ruby/           # "
  wolfram/        # "
```

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow
```bash
# JavaScript workspace
cd languages/javascript
npm install
npm test

# TypeScript workspace
cd languages/typescript
npm install
npm test

# Python workspace
cd languages/python
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest

# Java workspace
cd languages/java
mvn test
```

## 🧾 Artifacts
- `symlinks-backup.txt` – Historical record of removed symlinks (for audit only)
- `symlink-details.txt` – Mapping from deprecated symlinks to their new locations
- `validation-results.json` – Summary output from `npm run validate`

The repository is now ready for language-specific ownership and future workspace tooling.

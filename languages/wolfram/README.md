# Adaptive Tests for Wolfram Language - EXPERIMENTAL

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-orange.svg)](https://github.com/anon57396/adaptive-tests)

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL** - This Wolfram Language implementation is currently in development

AI-ready testing infrastructure for Wolfram Language that survives refactoring without breaking. When AI agents reshape your Wolfram notebooks and packages, traditional imports break. Adaptive Tests uses **zero-runtime discovery** powered by AST analysis to find code by structure, not file paths.

## Status

🚧 **This implementation is experimental and under active development.**

Current features:
- ✅ Basic Wolfram Language AST parsing
- ✅ Function and symbol discovery
- ✅ Pattern matching support
- ✅ Native Wolfram bridge integration
- ⚠️ Limited package system integration
- ⚠️ Basic notebook (.nb) support
- ⚠️ No cloud integration yet

## Planned Features

```mathematica
(* Load adaptive testing framework *)
Needs["AdaptiveTests`"]

(* Discover functions by signature *)
userService = DiscoverSymbol[
  "name" -> "UserService",
  "type" -> "Function",
  "patterns" -> {"_Integer", "_String"},
  "attributes" -> {"Listable"}
];

(* Test the discovered function *)
TestCase["UserService Discovery",
  result = userService[1, "test"];
  AssertTrue[Head[result] === User]
]

(* Discover by computational signature *)
calculator = DiscoverSymbol[
  "name" -> "Calculate*",
  "type" -> "Function",
  "domain" -> "Numeric",
  "patterns" -> {"_Real", "_Real"}
];

TestCase["Calculator Functions",
  result = calculator[2.5, 3.7];
  AssertTrue[NumericQ[result]]
]
```

## Wolfram-Specific Features

### Symbol and Function Discovery

```mathematica
(* Find functions by mathematical properties *)
integrationFunction = DiscoverSymbol[
  "name" -> "*Integrate*",
  "type" -> "Function",
  "domain" -> "Calculus",
  "attributes" -> {"HoldAll", "Protected"}
];

(* Find by pattern matching capabilities *)
patternMatcher = DiscoverSymbol[
  "name" -> "MatchPattern",
  "patterns" -> {"___", "PatternTest", "Condition"},
  "type" -> "Function"
];
```

### Notebook and Package Integration

```mathematica
(* Discover from notebook contexts *)
notebookFunctions = DiscoverFromNotebook[
  "file" -> "MyNotebook.nb",
  "context" -> "MyPackage`",
  "type" -> "Function"
];

(* Package-aware discovery *)
packageSymbols = DiscoverFromPackage[
  "package" -> "MyPackage`",
  "public" -> True,
  "attributes" -> {"ReadProtected"}
];
```

## Contributing

This is experimental work focused on Wolfram Language patterns:

1. **Wolfram AST improvements** - Better FullForm parsing
2. **Notebook integration** - Enhanced .nb file support
3. **Package system support** - Context and namespace awareness
4. **Cloud integration** - Wolfram Cloud function discovery
5. **Mathematical pattern matching** - Domain-specific discovery

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete notebook (.nb) file parsing and analysis
- [ ] Package system integration with contexts
- [ ] Mathematical domain-specific discovery patterns
- [ ] Wolfram Cloud function integration
- [ ] Enhanced pattern matching and rule discovery
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large mathematical computations

## Development Notes

Current implementation includes:
- `wolfram-bridge.wl` for native Wolfram Language integration
- `wolfram-ast-bridge.wl` for AST parsing and analysis
- Integration with Node.js discovery engine via MathLink
- Pattern matching for Wolfram-specific constructs (rules, patterns, etc.)

### Requirements

- Wolfram Engine or Mathematica 12.0+
- MathLink for Node.js integration
- Package management via PacletManager

## Unique Wolfram Features

The Wolfram Language's symbolic nature makes it uniquely suited for adaptive testing:

- **Symbolic computation**: Functions can be discovered by their symbolic properties
- **Pattern matching**: Native pattern matching enables sophisticated discovery
- **Mathematical domains**: Discover functions by mathematical properties
- **Notebook integration**: Test code directly within computational notebooks

This experimental implementation explores these unique capabilities.
